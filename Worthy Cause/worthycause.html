            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <!--this paragraph is about what the Ocean Cleanup is and what they are doing-->
                <p>The Ocean Cleanup's mission is to develop advanced technologies to ride the oceans of plastics.</p>
            <h3>Our Objectives</h3>
                <ul> <!--this is an unordered list that is listing the objectives of the company -->
                        <li> to develop and apply technologies (directly as well as indirectly) to remove- on a large scale- plastic pollution from the oceans</li>
                        <li> to develop and apply technologies (directly as well as indirectly) to remove plastic pollution from the waste streams to prevent it from reaching the oceans</li>
                        <li> to increase social awareness of the pollution of the marine environment by plastic; and other acts which is in the broadest sense relate or may be conduciveto the aforesaid objectives</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>What is the Plan?</h3>  
                <!--this paragraph is about the techniques that Ocean Cleanup is using-->
                <p>The Ocean Cleanup has made a form of technology that is estimated to cleanup the garbage within 5 years. It is environmentally safe, and cost less than expected.</p>
           <img id="machine" src="machine.jpeg" alt="the system that Ocean Cleanup is using" title="It launched in San Francisco and is estimated to be cleaning for around 5 years."/>
            <h4>How does it Work?</h4>
                <p id="float">The system consists of a 600 meter long  floater that sits at the surface of the water. The floater is a sort of blockade from other plastic flowing over it, while the machine gets garbage thats underneath the water. The system and the plastic are moving through the current, as well as, natural forces like wind. The systems fully rely on natural forces and do not require external energy, all electricity is powered by solar energy.</p>
                <p id="paragraph">The system was designed to clean the ocean while <i>not</i> harming the sealife. The systems are moving very slowly, allowing sea creatures to swim beneath the machine. </p>
